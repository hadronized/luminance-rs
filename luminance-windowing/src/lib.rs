//! # luminance windowing
//!
//! This is the base, abstract crate for windowing common types and functions in luminance. The
//! `luminance` crate provides you with abstracting over OpenGL, but it doesn’t give you a way to
//! create an OpenGL context. This is due to the fact that creating and managing OpenGL contexts is
//! tightly related to the type of application you target. Typical PC applications might need
//! something like **GLFW** or **glutin** whilst others will directly bind to **X11** or **Windows
//! API**. Several crates – `luminance-*` – exist to solve that problem. They all provide a
//! different implementation for a simple need: opening an OpenGL context, opening a window and
//! manage events. In theory, you could even have a `luminance-gtk` or `luminance-qt` to embed
//! `luminance` in surfaces in those libraries.
//!
//! # What’s included
//!
//! This crate exposes several important types that all backends must use. Among them, you’ll find:
//!
//! - `WindowDim`: abstraction over the dimension of a window and its mode (windowed, fullscreen, fullscreen
//!   restricted).
//! - `WindowOpt`: an opaque type giving access to hints to customize the window integration, such as whether
//!   the cursor should be hidden or not.
//!
//! The `Device` trait must be implemented by a backend so that an application is completely
//! agnostic of the backend. This trait defines several basic methods that will help you to:
//!
//! - Retrieve the dimension of the window / framebuffer.
//! - Iterate over the system events captured by your application.
//! - Draw and swap the buffer chain.
